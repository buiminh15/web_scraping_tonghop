Job Referrals from Company Insiders for Tech/Software Positions,2020-02-24 03:35,https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/d/san-francisco-job-referrals-from/7081290890.html, (financial district),"
        
The adage of ""It's who you know, not what you know"" really is difficult to reconcile when you feel like you have no network to get to your next career step.

Over the past 12 years, I heard this advice a lot as I moved around from city to city—both in the US and abroad. With every move, I had to rebuild my network, and it was *really* difficult each time.

If you're someone who's ever experienced a life transition, like a career change, having a child, or deciding to return to work after taking an extended leave, then this story is probably all too familiar.

If you're a woman, minority, or person with a non-traditional background which, when combined, represents the majority of the U.S. population, then it's *really* difficult to make any change because people already have these preconceived notions about you.

It's not an excuse, but an acknowledgment that biases are our reality.

Our reality is harsh on the job search. And we all could use help in fending off common biases in our job search so we can overcome the challenges we face in our transitions.

That's why we built JobFit - to help people in transition broaden the ""who you know,"" so you can show them your ""what you know."" We primarily assist people who are interested in transitioning to a new city for their next career step.

Whether you want to move for family, a change of scenery, or better opportunities, our goal is to help people find job referrals in cities where they want to work.

Find any job referral for any specific job to any particular company.

Our process of applying for job referrals is simple.

1. Find a company where you want a job referral.
2. Anonymously answer a few questions on what interested you about the company. Anonymity is to protect you from bias against your location, among other hiring bias.
3. A non-recruiter employee at the company will review your answers. If the employee likes your responses, they gain access to your name and resume for the job referral.


Here are some job referrals you can directly start connecting to right away:

JOB TITLE: Senior Business Systems Analyst
LOCATION: SAN FRANCISCO OR SACRAMENTO
JOB OPENING # 5160


OVERVIEW

The Judicial Council is transforming the way attorneys, justice partners, and the public conducts business with the California courts, the largest court system in the nation serving over 39 million residents. The Information Technology Office (JCIT) is responsible for introducing new technologies and electronic services to achieve the goal of a digital court. JCIT is directly responsible for the development, acquisition, implementation and support of automated systems in the appellate courts, trial courts and the Judicial Council.

The Judicial Council of California is accepting applications for the position of Senior Business Systems Analyst (Sr. BSA) for the Information Technology Administration office.  

The California Courts Protective Order Registry (CCPOR) is a statewide repository that provides judicial officers and law enforcement with access to restraining and protective order information. It is a vital tool for protecting individuals across California who are at risk of violence.

The Senior Business Systems Analyst position fulfills a critical function for the California Courts Protective Order Registry (CCPOR). The Sr. BSA is responsible for coordinating several concurrent projects with participation from large courts, as well as all law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that work with each court. Projects involve deploying CCPOR at courts and LEAs, onboarding and providing training for all staff that will use CCPOR, and providing ongoing support for CCPOR. The Sr. BSA works with court personnel to understand the business processes of the courts, develop business requirements, and ensure what is deployed meets the requirements. Where the court will use CCPOR directly, this position will configure CCPOR per the court's requirements. Where the court will use the CCPOR data exchange to integrate with their case management system (CMS), the position works with the court's CMS vendor to implement the changes. The Sr. BSA will also provide leadership in developing the strategic roadmap for CCPOR modernization. This includes developing BCPs to fund CCPOR modernization.

The Judicial Council strives for work life balance and includes substantial vacation and holiday time. In addition, we offer an excellent benefits package including pension, medical, dental and vision coverage, flexible spending, $130 monthly stipend towards public transit commuting costs, and retirement savings plans. In San Francisco, the office is only a 7-minute walk from the Civic Center BART station in downtown San Francisco.  In Sacramento, the office is located minutes from downtown, just north of Discovery Park. 

The successful candidate will be expected to work in the San Francisco or Sacramento office. 


RESPONSIBILITIES

• Analyze current and future state business processes. Document and develop strategic recommendations for enhancing CCPOR to improve processes to protect the public at risk.
• Develop, update, and maintain technical design specifications for software developers/programmers including data integration, database layouts, application modules, and user interface mock-ups.
• Develop functional release notes describing any changes to the CCPOR system. Distribute to and review with CCPOR users.

Project management for new CCPOR deployments

• Coordinate and conduct an interactive onsite kick-off meeting with the court CEO and designated personnel and their local LEAs.
• Develop the project schedule for deployment. Includes a work breakdown structure providing detailed activities, tasks, deliverables, work effort, elapsed time start and end dates, overall project timeline, dependencies  and resource assignments.
• Complete project close documentation
Support and Change Management
• Track and respond to user reports of issues and requests for assistance. Design and maintain a playbook that may be used by others to respond to common issues and requests.

•	Ability to interact politely with the occasional difficult customer.
•	Initiative in seeking ways to contribute to the success of the company that go beyond a narrow definition of job responsibilities.

•	Health and dental insurance
•	401k plan with company match

We are TechLX, a technology education company seeking programming instructors. One of our programs is a Middle School JavaScript class that meets in Redwood City on Wednesday afternoons from 1:20pm - 2:50pm. We are seeking a programming instructor that has experience working with teens, teaching, and programming.

The class runs the entire school year (three trimesters) cycling through 8th, 7th, and 6th grade students. We’d welcome you to stay for the coming trimesters as well should everything go well. Though this is just one class to start, we expect it to grow, and it would be great to bring on someone interested in sticking around as it morphs into more of a full-fledged engineering program, though this is not required. 

Currently, we are teaching the 6th graders, and we need a teacher and a TA who know at least basic JavaScript. The instructor should have some solid coding experience, as well as managing a classroom, since there are up to 30 students per grade. When you move on to teaching 7th and 8th grade sections, more JavaScript and client-side web dev skills will be required. 

Pay: $20 - $50 an hour depending on experience. Your hours will include any time you spend preparing for the class as well as class itself.

About TechLX
TechLX provides in-person, project-based technology education to the K-12 ecosystem through curriculum, instruction, and training. They help organizations integrate technology education into their curricula as well as develop and teach elective, afterschool and summer programs. Their programs focus on robotics, coding, game development, and makerspaces.
